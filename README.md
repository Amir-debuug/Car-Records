# # Car Records Test Overview

I build a complete authentication system with JWT security protocols. Management system of card records with create, edit delete and search funtionality.

# # Features

You can create a task with create button and also delete and edit a task as well. From top navbar you can search from task names and also a filter to filter task by make.

# # Funtionality
# # Front-end
I used React, Typescript and Material-UI to build this application. I used axios interceptors to build a complete authentication system. Used abort controllers to cancel unnecessory request to improve app performance and user experience.

# # Back-end
I used Node.js, Typescript for backend. I build to keep in mind about security standards and AWS. Dockerize everything for deployment on AWS.

# # Start-Application

open you're terminal and type 
``` docker compose up ```
